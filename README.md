Unreal Engine 5 Dead by Daylight repairing generators project.

Inspiration: Dead By Daylight generator repairing system, but without the skill checks and animations ( I do not know how to animate yet ).

Video preview : https://vimeo.com/963217849

Key used for Repairing : "E" As it is shown by the Interaction UI.

Made only with blueprints, easily readable with comments everywhere and specific variable and function names.
Everything created or modified is found in /All/Game/Generator and /All/Game/ThirdPerson/Blueprints.
